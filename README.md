## Context

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

### This Dataset Analysis will be divided in 4 parts :

#### *- Data pre-processing*
#### *- Data visualization*
#### *- Modeling*
#### *- Flask Predict API*

The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.

## In this Python Project, you will find :

#### A Jupyter Notebook
#### Data Visualizations
#### .plk files (created with joblib, a python library), which contains informations about applied Machine Learning models on this dataset
#### Flask based applications
